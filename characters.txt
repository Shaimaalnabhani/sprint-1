Elara, a spirited young villager with wind-tossed hair and eyes like stormy skies, stumbles upon a weathered map hidden in her grandmother’s attic. Fueled by boundless curiosity and quiet courage, she clutches the parchment, unaware it whispers secrets of forgotten realms—and that her ordinary world is about to unravel.

Shadow, a midnight-coated wolf with eyes like silver moons, moves like mist and guards Elara with unwavering devotion. Born beneath the Blood Moon, he understands the language of the forest and senses danger before it stirs. Fierce in battle, gentle at her side—he is her silent shadow, ever faithful.
