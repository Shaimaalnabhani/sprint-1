Years later, the Whispering Woods no longer whispered warnings—they sang songs of renewal.

Elara stood in the Heartgrove, now a blooming sanctuary where light spilled like gold through the once-solemn trees. She had solved the map’s riddle—not a treasure of gold, but of memory. Buried beneath roots and silence, she had found the forgotten Heartseed, a relic of the forest’s ancient pact with the village. With reverent hands and a brave heart, she restored its place in the grove’s stone altar, awakening a bond long severed.

Since then, Elderhollow had flourished. Crops grew richer, ailments faded, and laughter returned to places once hushed. The villagers spoke of Elara with warmth and wonder, calling her the Mapkeeper, the one who listened when the forest spoke.

And every spring, when the moonlight touched the Heartgrove just so, the trees would bloom silver, and the wind would carry a girl’s laughter—forever part of the story she helped remember.
