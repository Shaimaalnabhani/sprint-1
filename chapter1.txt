In the drowsy village of Elderhollow, where time slumbered beneath moss-covered rooftops and the wind carried tales older than memory, a curious boy named Corin stumbled upon a map that shouldn't have existed. It was stitched into the lining of an old satchel buried beneath his grandfather’s hearthstone, drawn in ink that shimmered like moonlight on water. The map whispered—not in words, but in feelings—pulling at something ancient nestled deep in his bones. Marked with forests that no villager dared enter and symbols lost to legend, it beckoned him toward the heart of the Whispering Woods, where silence was said to speak and shadows remembered your name

Elara spread the brittle map across the wooden floor, its faded ink pulsing faintly under moonlight as if stirred by breath long held. Symbols danced at the edges—trees with twisted roots, a silver river shaped like a serpent, and at the center, a crimson X scrawled over a place simply marked “Heartgrove.” The margins were scribbled with runes she couldn't read, but somehow understood, as if they were being translated not by her eyes, but by her blood. A shiver danced up her spine. The Whispering Woods had always been off-limits, a place of old tales and older silence—but the map seemed alive, calling her by name.

At dawn, with the first light kissing the village rooftops, Elara packed her satchel with bread, a flask, and her grandmother’s silver compass—long silent, now strangely humming. As she stepped beyond the village boundary, the woods loomed ahead like a cathedral of shadows and secrets. Trees bowed in greeting, or warning. Her heart thudded with both fear and fierce resolve. She glanced once more at the map. The ink glowed softly. The journey had begun—not just into the forest, but into the story that had always been waiting for her.
